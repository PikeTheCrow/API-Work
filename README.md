# API-Work
My playground for API development with various languages

All the APIs or API framework I create for practice will be stored here

APIs (by lang):
Dart
Elixir
Erlang
Go
Node

Simple APIs - nothing complex, merely understanding the basis of a few differently structured APIs.
Inspiration came from watching a talk delivered by a Tech Director from OPS Code (creators of CHEF)
